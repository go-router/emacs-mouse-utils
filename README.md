Emacs mouse utils
=================

A small emacs elisp util allows you manipulate emacs buffers and windows using mouse. You donâ€™t need selecting icons, borders or corners. Just click anywhere inside target window, the manipulation is triggered by relative movement of mouse/cursor.
Here is a screencast for its usage: http://youtu.be/rKSmzNG2i1w .

Copy mouse-utils directory to your local emacs packages. Add its path to "load-path" 
in .emacs as documented in dot_emacs. Add key bindings similar to the following:

* Move content inside window with mouse:

	* (define-key global-map [S-down-mouse-1] 'move-text-around)
	* click anywhere inside target window; 
	* hold down [Shift], press down [mouse-1] and move mouse inside window; 
	* the content of window will follow cursor; 
	* [if buffer has text auto-wrapped, the move to left/right will not have effect.]

* DragDrop to exchange windows' content:

	* (define-key global-map [S-drag-mouse-2] 'dragdrop-exchange-buffer)
	* click anywhere inside source window; 
	* hold down [Shift], press down [mouse-2] and move mouse to target window;
	* release [mouse-2] at target window;
	* source window and target window will exchange contents.

* Change window size by mouse:

	* (define-key global-map [C-down-mouse-1] 'change-window-size)
	* click anywhere inside target window;
	* hold down [Ctrl], press down [mouse-1] and move mouse;
	* target window will resize according to the relative movement of mouse/cursor;
	* other windows will resize automatically to accommodate target window size change.
